Your furry friend will play games and make friends under the supervision of our Kip crew, who know exactly when it's time for a game of fetch and time for a rest with dedicated nap time! When it comes to dog daycare, getting this balance right helps us make sure that every dog has a great time and goes home a happy dog.</p>",

              Kip offers an industry recognised Board &amp; Train Program which
              ensures building a cohesive relationship between you and your dog.
              <br />
              <br />
              The program is designed for those looking for a boarding service that includes dog training, that can help with many challenging behaviours including:
              <br />
              • pulling on the leash,
              <br />
              • reacting to other dogs,
              <br />
              • having selective hearing, and/or
              <br />
              • jumping all over you and your guests.
              <br />
              <br />
              The program encourages you to learn as your pooch learns - to enable you both to develop great life-long habits. This includes resources such as an online learning platform to complete, a comprehensive induction, and 1-on-1 handover with your dedicated trainer.
