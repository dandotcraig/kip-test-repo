    <h1>Identifying Dog Loneliness &amp; Tips for Doggy Dating</h1>
    <div class="content">
     
<p>“With more Australian pet parents returning to the office, vets and trainers like myself are increasingly seeing more dogs display signs of loneliness and sadly, separation anxiety. There was a surge in dog ownership in Australia during the COVID years, so we can presume that those pandemic puppies are finding their new way of life, i.e. their owners not around as often, challenging,” says Lara Shannon, one of Australia’s leading dog behaviourists and canine experts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to identify separation anxiety in your dog</strong></h2>



<p>Signs can range from the obvious to very subtle, and many are similar for dogs that are bored. Doggy daycare can, therefore, help with loneliness, separation anxiety and boredom.&nbsp;Signs may include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Following</strong> you around the home and watching you intently as you get ready for work. You may notice them trembling, licking their lips and flicking their tongue rapidly, pacing, increased drooling or salivation, and shaking.</li>



<li><strong>Over-exciting greetings</strong> when you get home.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Vomiting</strong> or diarrhea, defecating and/or urinating in unusual places and times, even when toilet trained.</li>



<li><strong>Not eating or drinking</strong> until you get home.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Licking themselves excessively</strong> – removing the hair, skin and sometimes, if a dog is in a constant anxious state, they can even wear away the tissue right down the bone.</li>



<li><strong>Excessive barking</strong>, whining, crying or howling.&nbsp; High-pitched rapid barking can indicate stress in dogs left alone. It’s worth videoing them when out, or checking with your neighbours as to what they hear or observe.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Hyper-vigilance</strong>, unable to relax when alone.</li>



<li><strong>Listlessness</strong> or sleeping all day can also indicate loneliness and/or boredom.</li>



<li><strong>Destructive behaviours</strong> occurring only when you are not around, such as digging, chewing, scratching doors or furniture and trying to escape the home.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are multiple ways to help mitigate dog loneliness and separation anxiety, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Human (or dog) company</strong>:&nbsp;Some dogs rely on a particular person or dog, others just need company of any description, so a furry friend, family member or&nbsp;doggy daycare can help.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Access inside the home</strong>:&nbsp;For many dogs that are kept outside, simply providing them with access inside the home, ideally your bedroom or lounge – can often result in immediate calm.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise &amp; mental stimulation: </strong>Establish a daily exercise and feeding routine and leave them with interactive toys, puzzles and long-lasting chews or bones&nbsp;to keep them occupied.</li>



<li><strong>Independence training</strong>:&nbsp;Start in small doses when you are at home, with their bed or crate in another room/outside and leaving them with a long-lasting chew, bone or interactive toy. Start so they can still see you, using a baby gate or window as a barrier. &nbsp; Work up to giving them a bone or long-lasting chew, set up your phone to record what they do, and calmly walk about the door and just walk around the block. Come back whilst they are still chewing and haven’t started to panic. Slowly increase the time away from them so panic never sets in.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Consider a dog walker</strong> to take them out in the middle of the day.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Change your departure routine and calm departures/arrival</strong>:&nbsp;Desensitise them to your departure, grab keys and bag when at home, and constantly change your routine.</li>



<li><strong>Calming products</strong>:&nbsp;In mild cases, calming pheromone sprays, collars and diffusers e.g. Adaptil for dogs may assist, as can a Thundershirt in cooler weather, Vet prescribed CBD Oil.</li>



<li><strong>Leaving the radio or TV&nbsp;on</strong>: classical music helps some dogs feel calm.</li>



<li><strong>Medication:&nbsp;</strong>Talk to your Vet, ideally, a Vet Behaviourist, for more than mild anxiety, as medication may be required to help with the behaviour modification training.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Setting up a doggy date for success</strong></strong></h2>



<p>So now you know the signs and have some ideas on what might work for your dog. Let’s talk about how to set them up for success.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="../../../images/blog1.jpg" /></noscript></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<ul>
<li><strong>Neutral territory</strong> is always best for first encounters between dogs, so have them meet outside and go for a walk together. If you want to socialise a puppy that isn’t yet fully vaccinated, a friend’s or neighbour’s place is good, and ensure all other pets are fully vaccinated.</li>



<li><strong>Introduce them in a controlled manner</strong>, with plenty of space between them.&nbsp;Try to have your dog sit and be calm so they don’t rush up to other dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<ul>
<li>Ideally <strong>on-lead</strong>, but be mindful of leash reactivity if they feel a bit anxious or frustrated. Always reward calm behaviour with a treat or praise.&nbsp;Never force interactions or allow one dog to jump all over another dog.</li>



<li>I always encourage any dog-to-dog greetings on lead to be done with the dogs being manoeuvred so they start by sniffing each other from behind rather than face to face.&nbsp;Count to 3 seconds, then give them some distance.&nbsp;(At 3 seconds dogs usually decide if they are either going to play or fight).</li>



<li><strong>Watch both dog’s body language</strong> at all times and for any signs of anxiety, including the subtle tongue flicking, yawning, tail tucked or submissive behaviours, and any aggressive reaction from either dog, which can also be a fear-based response.</li>



<li>Make sure the <strong>play is not one-sided</strong>. Ideally, they will be mimicking each other’s play style. Look for play bows, taking turns, pausing in between plays before both resuming again.&nbsp;A tag and run request, not to be confused with a dog coming up to nip at your dog, but rather when dogs are interacting nicely, and one bounces up to give a bit of a ‘tag’, then runs away, inviting your dog to chase.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Reward</strong> bigger dogs for playing gently with the younger or smaller pooch.</li>



<li><strong>Doggy daycares</strong> and businesses, like Kip, have the expertise to read dog behaviour and improve the way your dog interacts with other pups and can help with teaching your dog some manners.&nbsp;</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dog Behaviour to Watch Out For</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve got the tips, but how do you know if your dog is actually enjoying playing with their new best furry friend? Keep an eye out for the signs below, and remember, they can be subtle so be vigilant.</p>



<ul>
<li>One dog is constantly on top of the other or <strong>dominating</strong> the play.&nbsp;</li>



<li>A larger dog <strong>nipping</strong> or grabbing at a smaller dog or puppy’s neck, legs or body. A larger dog nipping or grabbing at a smaller dog or puppy’s neck, legs or body.</li>



<li>Be careful about letting two very strong dog breeds play too rough and bite each other too much, even if in play, as it can quickly escalate.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Likewise, <strong>watch the play</strong> between a number of dogs carefully because if one starts to feel threatened or anxious and acts out aggressively to protect themself, you want to be able to quickly remove all dogs calmly from the situation and not allow an all-out war to break out.</li>



<li>One dog is <strong>constantly chasing another and nipping at their heels</strong>. This is different to a tag &amp; chase. You might see this with working dogs chasing smaller dogs at the park, so you need to be careful it doesn’t start to get intimidating for the dog being chased so they feel harassed or threatened, or the instigator doesn’t start to get over-excited and up the biting levels.</li>



<li>One dog <strong>pouncing</strong> on another dog to wrestle when it is showing signs they aren’t comfortable.</li>



<li><strong>Mounting</strong>: there are many reasons why dogs hump, and it isn’t always dominance or sexual, but it isn’t great manners or can hurt another dog and set off a fight if an older dog has bad legs, or the other dog feels threatened.</li>



<li>Be extra careful if there are small and large dogs playing together as the risk can be higher.</li>
</ul>

    body: `   <h1><strong>What is dog reactivity and how is it managed?</strong></h1>
    <p>Dog reactivity is a common yet complex behavioural issue, rooted in a dog's emotional well-being and sense of
        safety i.e., fear. While ‘fear’ is the most prevalent cause of dog reactivity, it can also stem from other
        underlying emotions such as excitement or frustration.</p>
    <p>Once a dog has entered a reactive state, their internal pressure has built to the point of explosion i.e. a
        display of reactive behaviour (refer to Layered Stress Model below). Their ‘fight’ response has taken over
        and they cannot calm down until the ‘threat’ has subsided. </p>
    <img src="../../../images/layers_access.png" alt="doggy-daycare" />
    <p>Reactive behaviour varies greatly from dog to dog, therefore managing a dog with reactivity involves
        a customised approach including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifying their specific triggers</li>
        <li>Implementing positive reinforcement training techniques</li>
        <li>Making environmental adjustments</li>
        <li>Seeking professional guidance (especially when dealing with severe cases).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By recognizing these triggers, we become able to anticipate and prevent reactive outbursts in our dogs; if
        you can predict it, you can prevent it.</p>
    <h2><strong>What is a reactive dog?</strong></h2>
    <p>A reactive dog will respond faster and with more intensity than a non-reactive dog, displaying excessive
        levels of arousal such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive, hysterical barking</li>
        <li>Poor leash behaviour: constant pulling and movement, lunging towards the trigger,</li>
        <li>Tense body language, inc. raised hackles and fixed stare</li>
        <li>Panting, pacing, drooling - all out of context</li>
        <li>Avoidance behaviours: intensely sniffing, jumping, circling etc.</li>
        <li>Aggressive behaviours: reactivity can lead to aggression but does not necessarily indicate aggression
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A reactive dog becomes overly aroused and difficult to control, showcasing their heightened emotional
        response to the seemingly ordinary stimuli, that generally doesn't phase other dogs.</p>
    <p>A reactive dog is, more often than not, a fearful dog.</p>
    <h2><strong>What causes dog reactivity?</strong></h2>
    <p>Dog reactivity stems from various factors, often a combination of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Genetic predispositions
        </li>
        <li>Lack of proper socialisation</li>
        <li>Inadequate foundational training and confidence building</li>
        <li>Impactful, negative experiences during the Critical Period of Development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While genetic predispositions may increase a dog's likelihood of exhibiting reactive behaviour, it is
        important to recognise that genetics are only one component of the equation, and more often than not, <strong>a
            lack of proper socialisation is the more dominant factor.</strong></p>
    <p>The Critical Period of Development (0-16 weeks) is where puppies are the most receptive to new experiences
        and learning. Proper socialisation and foundational learning during the critical period, and beyond, is
        essential to shaping a puppy’s behaviour and temperament toward <strong>building an adult dog with confidence,
            resilience, and adaptability to change.</strong></p>
    <h2><strong>Are certain breeds more reactive than others?</strong></h2>
    <p>Reactivity is not solely determined by breed. While breed (genetic predisposition) can influence a dog's
        temperament and behaviour to an extent, it's important to understand that the dog's unique personality and
        learned experiences, regardless of their breed, are dominant factors when it comes to understanding and
        addressing reactivity.</p>
    <p>Note: Dogs bred for guarding or protection purposes may be more inclined to exhibit reactivity toward perceived
        threats e.g.Flock Guardian Breeds.</p>
    <h2><strong>Can a reactive dog be trained?</strong></h2>
    <p>Absolutely! All reactive dogs can be trained and their behaviour improved, as long as we:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand what is causing the reactivity (identify the trigger)</li>
        <li>Set our expectations accordingly (have clear goals mind)</li>
        <li>Prioritise their sense of safety</li>
        <li>Respecting the dog's boundaries and personal space</li>
        <li>Advance the training <strong>based on the dog’s progress</strong> from session to session</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reactivity is distressing for dogs; it’s important for us to acknowledge that not all dogs need to be friends
        with everyone/do everything - setting achievable goals (our expectations) is fundamental to effectively training
        a reactive dog.</p>
    <p>Remember the key principle: If you can predict it, you can prevent it.</p>
    <h2><strong>What’s involved in dog reactivity training?</strong></h2>
    <p>Training a reactive dog requires a tailored approach to the individual dog's needs and the owner's capabilities.
        The duration of this training will vary depending on the individual dog’s temperament, the severity of the case,
        and the consistency of the training efforts.</p>
    <p>In the initial stages, the primary objectives are to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the distance from the trigger, where the dog does not react (green zone - refer to image below)
        </li>
        <li>Redirect the dog's response from impulsive reactions to more neutral behaviours</li>
        <li>Boost the dog's overall confidence (as well as the owner)</li>
        <li>Equip both dog and owner with the skills to manage reactive outbursts effectively</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../../../images/reactive_chart.png" alt="reactive chart" />
    <p>Other factors involved in dog reactivity training:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Safety & Management:</strong> Ensure the safety of all involved, inc. the general public e.g., muzzles,
            barriers, training vests etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying Rewards/Reinforcers:</strong> Discover what motivates and excites your dog and first build its
            value away from the trigger e.g., treats, toys, or games</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying Triggers:</strong> Identify the specific triggers, whether they be scenarios, stimuli, movements,
            or
            sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Determine Critical Distance:</strong> Establish the distance at which your dog reacts to the trigger. This
            will vary throughout the process (refer to image below)</li>
        <li><strong>Desensitisation & Counter Conditioning:</strong> Pair the trigger with something your dog enjoys
            (rewards/reinforcers) to commence a new association with the trigger. Positive associations need to be
            reinforced consistently to create lasting behavioural changes</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Obedience:</strong> Give your dog ‘easy wins’ through simple obedience, teach alternate behaviours
            (e.g., look at me) to redirect their attention.</li>
        <li><strong>Calming Techniques:</strong> Teach your dog how to ‘switch off’ and learn to relax (e.g.m crate training).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Minimise Exposure:</strong> Limit exposure to the trigger outside of structured training sessions, to prevent
            setbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency & Patience:</strong> Countering dog reactivity takes time and cannot be rushed. Set reasonable
            expectations, remain consistent, and practice patience. Over time, the dog should develop a neutral or
            positive emotional response to the trigger.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Guidance Recommended:</strong> Gain professional help, especially for complex cases of
            reactivity. Kip’s Training Team has the knowledge, experience and expertise to work with all cases of dog
            reactivity.</li>

<p><strong>Socialisation:</strong> Dogs are social creatures, and regular interaction with other dogs and humans is crucial for their overall well-being. Doggy daycare provides a controlled environment for dogs to socialise, helping them develop better behaviour, improve their communication skills, and reduce anxiety or aggression.</p>



<p><strong>Exercise and Stimulation:</strong> Doggy daycare ensures that your furry friend gets plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Fun activities like group play, obstacle courses, and interactive toys help dogs burn off excess energy, keeping them fit and mentally sharp.</p>

<p><strong>Alleviating Separation Anxiety:</strong> Dogs with separation anxiety can find being left alone at home distressing. Doggy daycare offers companionship, reduces loneliness, and alleviates separation anxiety, leading to a happier and healthier pet.</p>



<p><strong>Professional Supervision:</strong> Trained staff members in doggy daycare centres closely monitor the dogs’ behaviour, ensuring their safety and stepping in when needed. This professional supervision adds an extra layer of security, giving pet owners peace of mind.</p>

    <div class="content">
     
<p>So you’ve seen pictures and videos of happy dogs in daycare, but is it right for your dog?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dog Daycare means your dog isn’t alone – they will also benefit from socialisation, enrichment, stimulation, and exercise!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many pet parents associate daycare with people who can’t work from home, but it’s not just for them. Doggy daycare provides a safe and fun environment for your dog while you’re away at work or busy with other commitments. Here are some benefits of doggy daycare for dogs:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of doggy daycare:</h2>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong><strong>Socialisation &amp; Social Cues</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Doggy daycare is a great way to let your dog socialise with other dogs in a safe and structured environment. Dogs are social animals and need interaction with other dogs to develop their social skills. </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img  src="../../../images/blog3-1.png" alt="Socialization" /></noscript></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>At daycare, they’ll meet new friends of all shapes and sizes and also learn how to behave around other dogs and read their social cues.&nbsp;This can help prevent aggression and other behavioural issues that can arise when dogs are not properly socialised.</p>



<p>At Kip, each dog is assessed by temperament, meaning they’ll only be placed with dogs that have a similar vibe to them. This can be especially helpful if your dog is shy and can help them to come out of their comfort zone.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<div><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3><strong>2. <strong>Mental &amp; Physical Exercise</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Another key benefit to daycare is that your dog will not only get lots of physical exercise, but they’ll also be sufficiently mentally stimulated. </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img src="../../../images/blog3-2.jpg" alt="physical exercise image" /></noscript></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>At doggy daycare, your dog will have access to a safe and secure play area where they can run, jump, and play to their heart’s content. This can help them burn off excess energy, stay fit and healthy, and reduce the risk of obesity and other health problems.</p>



<p>At Kip, our weekly activities will keep your dog entertained and get them to think. These activities include activities such as nose work, new tricks, obstacle courses and more.&nbsp;This can help reduce destructive behaviours, such as chewing or digging, that can result from boredom.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. <strong>Scheduled Routine</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Dogs thrive on routine, whether it’s at home, or at an external location. By keeping a routine, your dog is less likely to experience stress, and they can learn to adapt better to different environments too. In fact, some Kipsters claim that their dog knows what days are daycare days and can’t wait to get out the door (and into our doors!).&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img src="../../../images/blog3-3.jpg" alt="schedule routine image" /></noscript></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>We know the importance of scheduled play and rest too, giving your dog time to chill out and re-energise during the day so they’re not overwhelmed. This will also mean that your dog is constantly supervised to make sure they’re not up to any mischief.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. <strong>Supervision</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Dog getting up to no good? At doggy daycare, enjoy peace of mind that your dog will be properly supervised when you’re not around!</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img src="../../../images/blog3-4.jpg" alt="supervision image" /></noscript></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Doggy daycare provides a safe and supervised environment for your dog. Experienced staff members are trained to recognize signs of stress, aggression, or illness, and can intervene quickly if necessary. </p>



<p>All our Kipsters are ready to go and above for your dog, making sure they feel comfortable and happy during their visits to daycare (plus, they’re all super great cuddlers!).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Find the right daycare for you</strong></strong></h2>



<p>While daycare is beneficial to many dogs, each daycare is different, and your dog will react differently in each environment. It’s important to do your research, ask questions and raise any concerns you may have. At Kip’s <a href="https://kip.com.au/services/dog-daycare/">dog daycare</a>, we offer site tours, so you can see exactly where your dog will play, and you’ll also receive regular photo updates to ensure peace of mind.</p>

<p>How to choose a cat harness is one of the most commonly-asked questions by new cat parents. Your curious cat likes to climb all over the place, so keeping them safe when you’re out together can be tricky. <a href="https://kip.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kip cat and dog boarding</a> has multiple locations around Australia, including <a href="https://kip.com.au/locations/brisbane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brisbane</a> and <a href="https://kip.com.au/locations/hunter-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hunter Valley</a>, and we’ve got years of experience keeping your fearless feline feeling safe and loved. In this article, we’ll discuss how to choose a cat harness, give you some examples of the best cat harnesses and let you know how to put a harness on your cat. We hope this article will help you know how to choose a cat harness that’s fantastic for your feline.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cat Harness</h2>



<p>First thing’s first: what do you need to know about choosing a cat harness? You might be looking for a cat harness because you’ve got an active, outgoing feline master who demands you accompany them on their daily survey of their kingdom. Or perhaps you’ve got to take a scaredy-cat to the vet. Maybe you just want to be able to take your terrific tabby travelling. Either way, we’re here to help with some great cat harness tips.</p>



<p>There are, of course, lots of things to consider when choosing a cat harness outside of how it looks! Our feline friends are all different and can be sensitive and picky. So, you may need to do some harness experimentation. In general, though, some of the main points to remember when thinking about buying a cat harness are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fit</li>



<li>Leash type</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="../../../images/blog4-1.jpg" alt="cat harness" /></noscript></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fit</h3>



<p>It might go without saying but it is important that you make sure you buy a cat harness. Dog harnesses are made for the broader shoulders and build of a dog and can be easy for your feline to free themselves from. Cats also have more delicate throats than dogs. Harnesses made specifically for cats have more cushioning to protect this area and offer a better, more streamlined fit. Remember also that your cat moves differently to a dog. Cat harnesses allow them to move freely the way they like to, which in turn makes them more likely to let you put them on a leash.</p>



<p>There are many different types of cat harness. The most popular, however, are h-harnesses and figure-of-eight. What the best one for you and your feline is depends on what you’re looking for. Expect to experiment with different types – cats can be stubborn, after all!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leash Type</h3>



<p>You can buy different leash types for your cat’s harness. Some are more rigid than others. If you’re worried about meeting other cats when you’re out then you might find a firmer leash works better for you. A firmer leash will make it easy to control your kitty and keep them safe from less friendly fellow felines. On the other hand, more adventurous cats might prefer a more flexible leash. We’ll leave the leash experimentation up to you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cat Harness Australia</h2>



<p>You need to consider the climate when choosing a harness for your Aussie kitty. Vest harnesses are great for cat harness Australia when the weather is hot, allowing them to keep cool while they move and enjoy the nice weather. On the other hand, jacket cat harnesses Australia can be used when the weather is cooler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The material makes a difference, too. Mesh harnesses help to keep your kitty cool but tend to pick up dust and sand. Harnesses made with nylon are sturdier but can dig in to your cat’s delicate coat. Keep these things in mind when kitty harness shopping.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Cat Harness</h2>



<p>What the best cat harness is for your feline depends on many things. There’s no need to get overwhelmed, though. We’ve narrowed down the things your harness needs to have to be crowned the best cat harness for your feline ruler. Apart from your cat’s willingness to try a harness, some of the best cat harnesses are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Safe</li>



<li>Well-made</li>



<li>Comfortable</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Safe</h3>



<p>Of course, the best cat harness is a safe one. One that your cat can’t crawl out of. Buying a harness made for cats ensures you get one that is streamlined to a cat’s body. It’s best to buy a harness that’s snug, but not tight. You should be able to fit two fingers between the harness and your cat. Your feline may still be firmly fixed on freeing themselves, but it’ll be a harder task with a harness that’s made for them!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Well-made</h3>



<p>We all want the best for our feline friends, and their harness is no exception. Even if you only use the harness a couple of times a year to take kitty to the vet, you need to know you can rely on it to do the job. In general, the best cat harnesses cost $20-35. Buying from a local pet store helps ensure the harness will be good-quality. Make sure to ask about the store’s return policy, too, in case your kitty decides it’s not for them. Research cat harnesses in advance to decide what’s the best type for your cat or you can ask your vet for recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comfortable</h3>



<p>Even the most willing harness-wearing cats don’t like to have their movement restricted. If that’s the case for your kitty, consider experimenting with different harness types. It’s also a good idea to consider how the harness is attached. Many kitties are sensitive to the noise Velcro makes. You can help your cat get used to this type of harness by making the Velcro noise during playtime, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="../../../images/blog4-2.jpg" alt="best cat harness" /></noscript></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Put on a Cat Harness</h2>



<p>Asking how to put on a cat harness is often another way of asking how to persuade your feline master to allow you to put a harness on them. But that title isn’t as catchy. How to put on a cat harness depends, of course, on the cat. To avoid getting mauled, you might consider the slow and steady approach. Get your kitty used to the harness by making it a part of playtime or mealtimes. Once they’ve had a few days of this, gently put the harness on their back and reward them with food or play. The next step would be finally attaching the harness to them and, again, rewarding them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also consider the type of harness, too. Some harnesses are easier to put on than others. Step-Ins are probably the easiest to attach but can be easier to wriggle out of. Figure-of-eight are some of the more difficult to attach, but also among the most secure. Be patient with your feline friend and work together to figure out which harness is best for you both.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Escape Proof Cat Harness Australia</h2>



<p>Ah, the big question – How to find an escape proof cat harness Australia. Our feline rulers can be fiendish and sly and put the great Houdini to shame with their twisty tricks. If you’re despairing trying to keep your kitty under control, don’t panic. We’ve got some great escape proof cat harness Australia tips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first thing to remember, though, is: <strong>no harness is ever going to be 100% kitty escape proof.</strong> If your cat is determined to launch their rendition of The Great Escape, you’d better believe they’ll succeed. You’ll also need to remember to update your harness as kitty grows (remember to buy a harness for <em>cats, not dogs</em>) or when the weather changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next thing to remember is: <strong>training is important. </strong>Even if your pussycat lacks patience, you don’t have to. Part of having an escape proof cat harness Australia is patience. With patience (and, of course, time), you can persuade your precious pussycat prince or princess to wear a harness. Make wearing one a part of your kitty’s daily routine. Allow them to get used to wearing one in the comfort of their own kingdom (or, as you know it, your home). Then, take them outside. By slowly introducing them to the idea of the harness, you stand a better chance of success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wow, there are a lot of things to think about when choosing a harness for your cat. But we hope this article has helped you narrow down the things to consider. Perhaps one of the most important takeaways from this article is that you’re going to need patience. A lot of it. You likely already know that, being a cat servant, after all. Don’t get discouraged if harnessing your cat takes longer than you expected. And, remember, some cats just won’t take to harnessing, even if you give it all you’ve got. If that’s the case, just jot it down to experience and enjoy being a loyal subject to your cat ruler.&nbsp;</p>

We hope you’ll find this article helpful in your Australian dog breeds search, and that you’ll find a doggie breed – and doggie – to love and become part of your family.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dog Breeds Australia</h2>



<p>There are a number of dog breeds Australia that you should know about. You’ve most likely heard of the dingo – Australia’s legendary wild dog. Many other awesome doggies call Australia home too, including the sweet and friendly Australian cobberdog, hard-working kelpie, peppy Silky terrier and many more. In this article, we’ll talk about a few of these dog breeds Australia and what makes them so special.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Banned Dog Breeds Australia</h2>



<p>But first, though, we should mention a few of the pooches on the banned dog breeds Australia list. If you’re looking to bring a precious pooch home to Aus, you’ll have to know these rules. Banned dog breeds in Aus include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pit Bull Terrier breeds&nbsp;</li>



<li>Dogo Argentino</li>



<li>Fila Brasileiro</li>



<li>Japanese Tosa</li>



<li>Perro de Presa Canario (or Presa Canario)</li>
</ul>



<p>Most of the dogs on the list of banned dog breeds Australia are dogs known for their aggressive nature. The Dogo Argentino, for example, was bred for big game hunting, such as hunting wild boar. Mix breeds and breeds that look similar to any of the banned dogs are also restricted in Aus. Not all states and territories in Australia have the same rules on banned dog breeds, though. The Australian Veterinary Association [<a href="https://www.ava.com.au/policy-advocacy/policies/companion-animals-dog-behaviour/breed-specific-legislation/">Link here</a>] has more information on the dog breeds that are banned in Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dog Breeds In Australia</h2>



<p>The number of different dog breeds in Australia is as long as your arm! Of course, there are some breeds better suited to our Australian climate than others. These dogs can cover long distances, or deal well with the cold and heat. Now, we’re giving special mention to the following dog breeds in Australia – the dingo and the Australian kangaroo dog.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dingo</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="../../../images/blog5-1.jpg" alt="dogs-breed-image" /></noscript></figure>



<p>The dingo is probably the most well-known dog breeds in Australia. It’s over 4000 years old and, although we love to say it’s an Aussie dog breed, it might actually have come from Asia! Dingoes cope well in Australia’s climate, but aren’t really suitable as pets. They’re aggressive, difficult to train and need a lot of space to run around. That’s not to say you couldn’t have one as a pet, though. They’re legal to own in some Aussie states and territories. For example, you don’t even need a license for one in New South Wales!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Kangaroo Dog</h3>



<p>If you’ve been doing your Aussie doggie swotting, you’ll have heard of the Australian Kangaroo Dog (or ‘roo dog for short!) They’re not, perhaps, one of the most famous dog breeds in Australia but they’re certainly worth a mention because of the unique reason they were bred. This pooch was popular in Aus because of its prowess as hunting dog. No prizes for guessing what they hunted, though – it’s in the name! Whilst they’ve not been around as long as dingoes, they’re not the new dog on the block either. You can find records of this hunting hound going back as far as 200 years. Nowadays they’ve been replaced in popularity by other working dogs, but you can still find these precious pups living on farms or large stations in Aus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Dog Breeds Australia</h2>



<p>The best dog breeds Australia are breeds that can cope with the changing Aussie climate. That means hardy hounds that can handle:</p>



<ul>
<li>Heat</li>



<li>Cold</li>



<li>Dust</li>



<li>Long distances</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, what you consider to be on the best dog breeds Australia list depends on your preferences, where you live and how much space you have. To help you narrow down what your prospective pooch will be, we’ve put together an Australian dog breeds list. We hope you’ll find it helpful and that you’ll find a new four-legged friend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Dog Breeds List</h2>



<p>On this Australian dog breeds list we’ll discuss a few of the Aussie doggies suitable as pets. They’re affectionate, loyal and great with families. These breeds also tend to cope well with the Australian climate and look absolutely adorable doing it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Cobberdog</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="../../../images/blog5-2.jpg" alt="special-australian-breed" /></noscript></figure>



<p>‘Cobber’ is Aussie slang for ‘friend’. What better name for this friendly sweetheart? This Aussie doggie got its name for being a great family pet. Loyal, friendly and affectionate, this Aussie doggie is also a great therapy and assistance pet. The Cobber is a pure breed Labradoodle – and just as lovely. Their gorgeous coat, which can range from dark to light coloured, is hypoallergenic. This means it doesn’t shed much and produces less dander, which is what causes those irritating allergic reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Silky Terrier</h3>



<p>What this pup lacks in size, they certain make up for in gusto! This peppy pup is descended from Australian and Yorkshire terrier breeds and is most certainly feisty. Whilst their tendency to bark might drive your neighbours barking mad, these hot-blooded hounds can be easily trained. They’ve got a lot of energy for play and can live comfortably in an apartment if you can match their eagerness for exercise. Their long hair tends towards tangles, so you’ll want to brush it regularly. Good news, though, is that their luscious locks are hypoallergenic, so you won’t be doing too much sneezing when you’re doing all that brushing!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tenterfield Terrier</h3>



<p>The Tenterfield terrier is a tender breed. They love cuddles, are loyal to family and outgoing, making them a great addition to any loving home. Like Silkys, they can bark a lot. But you can easily train them to more tacit tones with a little bit of love and patience. Unlike the silky terrier, Tenterfields are easy to keep tidy. They don’t need much more than a weekly wash and occasional brush. Unfortunately, if you’re prone to the sniffles, you’ll want to steer clear of this pup, as they’re not hypoallergenic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Working Dog Breeds</h2>



<p>Next we’ll discuss a few of the Australian working dog breeds. These dogs are all active, loyal and hard-working. Bad news for allergy sufferers, though – these hardy hounds may be hyper, but they’re not hypoallergenic. Because they’re bred to be active animals, they’re not well-suited to apartment living. They’re happiest doing a lot of exercise and with a lot of space to call home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Cattle Dog</h3>



<p>This hardy hound is bred for sheep herding and is happiest when out and about. These Aussie doggies need a lot of exercise to prevent them getting bored and wrecking the place. They’re fiercely loyal to family and suited to family life if you’re active and have a lot of space for them to run about. They will tend to nip anything that moves – cars, pets and even children. You can train them to know the difference between what’s nippable and what’s not, though. Because the Aussie cattle dog lives an active life you’ll probably have to bathe and brush them quite often. They only shed once or twice a year though, which is a plus if you’re not a confident groomer.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Australian Kelpie</h3>



<p>Kelpie’s are the doggie descendants of Scottish collie dogs, although many people think of them as a truly Aussie doggie. This Australian working dog breeds can cover long distances, which is why they’re used to herd sheep. Like many working dogs, Kelpie’s are also suited to search and rescue work or any kind of service work with an active pace. They’re loyal, intelligent and easy to train. Their coat doesn’t shed much and they’ve not got a tendency towards packing on the pounds like other dog breeds.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Koolie</h3>



<p>The Koolie is another peppy pup that loves nothing more than working hard rounding up sheep, or as an active service dog. They’re a patient pup and don’t lean towards play. You can rely on them to get the job done. Their temperate nature can be mistaken for shyness. These Aussie doggies can be dominant and destructive if not kept active. Their short coat can be black, red or chocolate in colour and is short so it’s easier to keep clean.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where we leave you, but we hope you’ve found this article awesome and that we’ve piqued your interest to find out more about the many precious pups that call Australia home.&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>How Often Should You Wash Your Dog?</h1>
    <div class="content">
     
<p>As a new dog owner there’s no shortage of unknowns and confusion, and sooner or later you find yourself asking how often you should wash your dog. Here at <a href="https://kip.com.au/">Kip</a> we’ve got plenty of experience with dogs getting dirty after an action-packed day and so we know a thing or two about washing them afterwards. Our dog boarding at <a href="/locations/hunter-valley/">Kip Hunter Valley dog hotel</a> and <a href="/locations/brisbane/">Kip dog hotel Brisbane</a> offer five-star wash and grooming service for your pampered pooch. Our experienced staff know there’s no single answer to how to primp your pooch. There are a number of things to think about; your canine’s coat type, lifestyle, allergies – the list goes on. But don’t stress. We’ve got plenty of tips and tricks to keep your canine clean.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Should You Wash Your Dog?</h2>



<p>When it comes to tub-time, most experts recommend using products specifically formulated for dogs. Using human shampoo can harm your hound, as human skin has a much more acidic pH than dog skin. As such, human shampoo is more acidic than dog shampoo and should be avoided.</p>



<p>There is a right and a wrong technique to wash your dog, too. Some tips when washing your woofball include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Checking the water’s temperature</li>



<li>Brushing their coat out before and after bathing</li>



<li>Using a gentle rinsing method</li>
</ul>



<p>We all know our doggies can be sensitive souls, so things like too hot water or a strong shower spray can upset them. To reduce the risk of ear infections after bathing it’s recommended that you regularly clean your dog’s ears using an ear-cleaning product and dry them fully afterwards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re also all for non-slip mats. Available from most pet stores or regular superstores, a bath mat can help ensure a pleasant bath time for your pup without slips and trips.</p>



<p>Another great tip is a lick pad. This aptly-named gadget is a wonderful way to wash your pup whilst keeping them distracted and happy with a snack. Spread some peanut butter on the pad, stick it to the wall in your bathroom and let pup lick away whilst you wash away pup’s pong.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="../../../images/blog6-1.jpg" alt="wash your dog" /></noscript></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Often Should You Wash Your Dog?</h2>



<p>Now to the big question: how often should you wash your dog? Obviously you should always try to wash them if they smell or are dirty, regardless of how little time has passed since their last bath. After all, cuddles on the couch are a whole lot nicer when your pup’s smelling peachy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what other factors should you consider when you’re looking for a standing slot in your dog’s diary? In general, we recommend you consider the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lifestyle</li>



<li>Coat type</li>



<li>Allergies/skin conditions</li>



<li>Season</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lifestyle</h3>



<p>If your pup is the playful sort who’s prone to getting dirty, you’re probably going to want to wash them more often than your coach potato canine. If you’re looking to become a pet parent but aren’t sure you can handle frequent bathtimes, consider the following. You could get an older dog, as they’re less likely to want to run around getting dirty. If you’re set on getting a puppy, then you could look for a more sedentary dog breeds. Greyhounds or Mastiffs are great for prospective pet parents looking for low-maintenance dogs. There’s no shame in choosing a canine based on these factors. After all, you want to know that your new furry family member will fit in and enjoy being with you as much as you enjoy being with them.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Coat Type</h3>



<p>Your canine’s coat type is important, too. It’s not a simple case of the more fur your furball has, the more often you bust out the shampoo, though! Hairless breeds can be quite labour-intensive when it comes to bath time. The hairless Chinese Crested, for example, needs a bath every two weeks, can you believe it?! The Siberian Husky, on the other hand, only needs a rinse once a month or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Allergies/Skin Conditions</h3>



<p>Medicated washing can help relieve your poor pooch’s allergies/skin conditions. Often, your vet will prescribe medicated shampoos or creams specifically for your dog, so you don’t need to worry about what pooch products to buy. In the case of ticks and fleas, some dogs may not respond well to taking medications. In this case, regular baths can help control the creepy crawlies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Season</h3>



<p>The season also plays a role in how often you should wash your dog. You should bathe your scruffball more often in the winter and spring. Why these seasons? Harsh winter weather can dry out your four-legged friend’s skin and make it itchy. Regular baths with moisturising dog shampoo can help ease this itch. As for spring – dogs tend to shed fur once warm spring weather arrives, since they don’t need such a thick coat anymore. You can help control your fluffball’s fluff by washing them often.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="../../../images/blog6-2.jpg" alt="tips-to-wash-your-dog-image" /></noscript></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Know If You’re Washing Your Dog Too Much</h2>



<p>By now, you know why it’s important to wash your dog and how to do it. But how exactly do you know if you’re washing your dog too often?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your precious pooch’s skin produces protective oils that keep its coat healthy. Washing your dog too often can strip the skin of these oils and leave your doggy feeling down. A sure-fire way to tell if you need to cut down on the tub-time is if your dog’s skin is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Itchy</li>



<li>Inflamed</li>



<li>Sore</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s always good to consult your vet to track down the cause of any of these skin symptoms. They can rule out ticks/fleas and allergies and guide you in finding the right tub-time timetable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dog Wash Near Me</h2>



<p>One thing’s for sure – not all dogs love bath time and not all dog owners are confident enough to do bath time at home. Your four-legged friend deserves the best, so if the idea of doggie bathtime makes you wobbly, you might be better off calling in the professionals. If you’re close enough to a Kip it’s always a great idea to come in for a quick dog wash, but if you’re a bit further afield then searching for dog wash near me is a quick and easy way to see all the nearby available dog bathing experts, as well as more information such as customer reviews and website links. Remember, though, that dog wash near me searches will show you doggie bathing salons, as well as mobile dog washes. So, if you’re after a doggy hairstylist and grooming expert that’ll come to you, you may wish to search for mobile dog wash.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mobile Dog Wash</h3>



<p>If your dog wash near me search doesn’t give you the results you need, try looking for a mobile dog wash. There’s no shame in calling in the experts. After all, you want to give your pooch the best care you can, and if that means hiring an expert to come to you, then so be it!</p>



<p>Mobile dog wash salons are great for the times when you just can’t face bathtime or don’t have the time to get down to a local salon. These grooming experts will come to your home, so they’re super convenient, particularly if you have a doggy that doesn’t like to travel. Many mobile dog wash experts offer a range of services, from wash, blow dry, nail trim and even flea and tick treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mobile Dog Wash Prices</strong></h4>



<p>Mobile dog wash prices vary, depending on location and the services you go for, and it’s generally a good idea to request a quote in advance. In general, though, mobile dog wash prices tend to be around $30-$50 per hour. If that sounds a bit of a stretch, you can always go back to your dog wash near me search and see if any of your local pet grooming salons are willing to do a home visit.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Dog Wash?</h2>



<p>Bathing your furball is important, and not just for the reasons you might think. Dogs need a wash to help maintain their skin, coat and general health. Washing your dog can be great bonding time. It also is a great chance to check for any suspicious lumps or fleas in between vet visits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Washing your dog has many benefits. These include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the pong following your pooch</li>



<li>Removing dead skin, debris and loose hair to keep your dog looking dapper</li>



<li>Following your pooch’s medical treatment plan (if they have a skin condition)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs Your Dog Has A Skin Condition</h3>



<p>One of the main reasons to wash your dog is if they’ve got a skin condition. Common skin conditions affecting dogs include ticks/fleas, impetigo and dandruff. Among other symptoms, hair loss, itching and redness can be a sign that your dog has a skin condition and needs to see a vet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over-washing your dog can actually cause some skin conditions. Washing your dog too often can strip doggy’s skin of its natural protective oils, causing dryness, irritation and inflammation – more on this later!</p>



<p>We hope this article has been helpful and you’re feeling confident about bathing your dog (and maybe even really looking forward to dog wash day!) If you have any doubt about the right splash-session schedule for your sweet pup, it’s a good idea to speak to your vet who’ll be able to help you.&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>Pet Boarding vs Pet Sitting: The age-old debate</h1>
    <div class="content">
     
<p>You've booked a holiday. or you're goina awav. but your pet can't come with you - what to do? There
are a multitude or options nowadays: pet boarding, pet sitter, friends, family... The list goes on</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's the difference between pet boarding and sitting?</h2>



<p>The best way we’ve heard pet boarding described is it’s like taking your pet to a hotel, except all the guests are pets! Your pet will be waited on hand and paw after trained professionals to ensure they get enough to eat, play, and rest.</p>



<p>On the other hand, pet sitting can be more tailored, where an individual stays with your pet either at your own home, their home, or stops by to care for your pet based on a schedule agreed upon. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So which one should you choose?</h2>
<p>The answer: it will depend on your dog! Each dog has different needs and responds to each environment differently. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Always do your homework!</h2>
<p>Just like no two pets are the same, no two sitters nor boarding facilities are the same. In Australia, each state has their own rules and regulations that each boarding facility and pet sitter must follow, so it’s important that you look into them to see if your options are meeting this baseline.</p>
<p>Another great idea is to tour the boarding facility, or meet with the pet sitter prior to the actual stay. At Kip, all our locations offer tours of our facilities so you can see exactly where your pet will stay. We also recommend doing a shorter stay first to make sure your pet is well-suited and to get them comfortable, and to make sure you have peace of mind too, so you know what to expect when you go away for a longer period of time.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does pet boarding look like?</strong></h3>

<p>Times have definitely changed within the last decade, and pet boarding locations are no longer just a practicality. In fact, our Kip locations offer add-ons, from extra treats, a roast chicken dinner, playtime, or you can even choose from luxury rooms, bushwalks or pool sessions, depending on which location you’re after! You’ll also receive regular photo and video updates from our team so you can see exactly what your pet is up to while you’re gone.</p>

<p>We understand that your four-legged friends deserve the world, and we want to replicate the care that they would have at home.</p>

    <h1>Dog Anxiety - Signs, Symptoms, & What You Can Do</h1>
    <div>
     
<p>We all adore our four-legged pals, but did you know dogs can get anxious too? Yep, it’s true! Just like us, they can experience those jitters that make their tails curl and paws sweat, which can significantly impact their well-being and quality of life. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of dog anxiety is crucial for providing the support and care they need.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Dog anxiety can manifest in various ways, and it’s essential to be attentive to behavioural changes. Common signs of anxiety in dogs include:</p>

<p>Doggy daycare is a service that provides supervised care and socialisation opportunities for dogs during the day. </p>

<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 37%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>The cost of doggy daycare can vary based on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location,</li>



<li>Amenities offered,</li>



<li>Staff-to-dog Ratio, and</li>



<li>Any additional services provided.</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, larger cities and areas with a higher cost of living tend to have higher daycare prices. Fancy facilities with spacious play areas, indoor pools, webcams for pet monitoring, and personalised attention will naturally be more expensive than simpler daycare options.</p>

<p>On average, doggy daycare can range from $15 to $60 per day. This price usually covers a full day of daycare, lasting around 8 to 10 hours. Some places might offer half-day options at a lower rate. Moreover, many doggy daycare centres provide discounted rates for weekly or monthly packages, allowing pet owners to save some bucks while ensuring their dogs get regular socialisation.</p>



<p>At Kip, prices will vary based on which location you visit, how frequently you visit, and how long your dog is at one of our daycares.</p>

<p><strong>Socialisation:</strong> Dogs are social creatures, and regular interaction with other dogs and humans is crucial for their overall well-being.

    <h1>Tips for Pet Parents over the Holiday Season</h1>
    <p>You’ve booked a holiday, or you’re going away, but your pet can’t come with you – what to do? There are a multitude of options nowadays: pet boarding, pet sitter, friends, family… The list goes on.</p>


    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >House Rules</h2>
    <p>Having family and friends over is always fun, but you should also make sure that any guests are aware of your house rules with your pet. Maybe your pet needs a gentle touch and doesn’t want to run around all the time with little children, or maybe they don’t want to be bothered when they’re eating their food – establishing these boundaries early on will keep everyone safe and happy. </p>


    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Stay Hydrated and Cool</h2>
    <p>Christmas Down Under usually means hot days in the sun, which is good for a tan, but not so good for your pet if they’re outside all the time. Make sure your pet has ample fresh water to keep them hydrated and access to shade at all times. Remember, if it’s too hot for you, it’s even warmer for your pet with their fur coats.</p>


    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Noise Anxiety</h2>
    <p>Loud noises such as fireworks, thunderstorms, and crackers can startle your dog and possibly damage their sensitive ears. You can help to desensitise themselves from the noise in the lead-up to Christmas and give them a safe place to retire if there’s too much stimulation.</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Keep Doors Secure</h2>
    <p>The holiday festivities may not be an environment your pet is familiar with, and as guests trickle in, an open door is a potential escape route. Make sure that your pet is properly secured and that guests know not to leave doors and gates open.</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Decor can be Dangerous</h2>
    <p>While putting up Christmas decorations can be a family occasion, these can be a hazard for pets. Baubles, tinsel, Christmas lights, wrapping paper, and wrapping ribbon can all be potential choke hazards or even risk electric shock if chewed. Even Christmas Tree water can be toxic to your pets! Make sure to keep an eye on your pet, keep décor away from them, and clean up as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Don’t Fall for those Puppy Dog Eyes</h2>
    <p>A bit of some Christmas feast for our pets can seem like a good idea, but some holiday foods can be fatal for pets. Keep them away from foods that include alcohol, avocados, chocolate, Christmas pudding, cooked bones, lollies, onion, and pork. Instead, give them a little extra Christmas treat with a Christmas pup-cake, or extra cuddles and play.</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Give your dog their own Staycation</h2>
    <p>Otherwise, take all the stress out of the holiday period and let someone else take care of your pet for you! Kip is a pet boarding provider with locations all around Australia that specialise in giving your pet a home away from home. Your four-legged friends will enjoy private rooms, outdoor yards to play in, nutritious meals and treats, and the opportunity to socialise and make new friends.</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" >Sh!t Happens</h2>
    <p>While all pet parents do their best to have a safe and stress-free holiday, emergencies do happen. Make sure you know who to call and which vets are open for the holiday season.</p>

<p>Dogs are pack animals by nature and crave social interaction with other dogs or their pet parents. When they are left alone for extended periods of time, they may experience separation anxiety and loneliness. This can lead to a variety of negative behaviours, such as destructive chewing, barking, or even aggression.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that each dog is different and may respond differently to being left alone. Some dogs may be perfectly content being left alone for several hours, while others may become anxious and restless after just a few minutes. Factors such as age, breed, temperament, and previous experiences can all play a role in how a dog responds to being alone</p>

<h2>So, how can you tell if your dog is feeling lonely?</h2>
<p>Some common signs include excessive barking or howling, destructive behaviour, loss of appetite, lethargy, and even depression. These behaviours may indicate that your dog is feeling stressed and in need of more social interaction and attention. Fortunately, there are several things you can do to help your dog feel less lonely, including:</p>

<ol>
      <li>Provide plenty of exercise and playtime: Regular exercise and playtime can help your dog expend energy and reduce stress levels. This can help prevent boredom and loneliness from setting in.</li>
      <li>Give your dog a safe and comfortable space: Provide your dog with a comfortable bed or crate where they can rest and relax. This can help them feel secure and safe when you’re not around.</li>
      <li>Consider doggy daycare or a pet-sitting service: If you work long hours or have other commitments that keep you away from home for extended periods of time, consider hiring a dog walker or pet sitter to come in and spend time with your dog. Alternatively, you can enrol your dog in a doggy daycare program where they can interact with other dogs and receive plenty of attention and playtime.</li>
      <li>Provide mental stimulation: Dogs are intelligent animals that need mental stimulation to stay happy and healthy. You can provide your dog with interactive toys, treat puzzles, or even hide treats around the house to keep their minds engaged.</li>
      <li>Use calming aids: Some dogs may benefit from the use of calming aids, such as pheromone sprays or diffusers, or even music specifically designed to calm dogs.</li>
</ol>
